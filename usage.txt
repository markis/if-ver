  -eq - is equal to
  -ne - is not equal to
  -gt - is greater than
  -lt - is less than
  -ge - is greater than or equal to
  -le - is less than or equal to

  Only run eslint if node version is at least 4:

  if-ver -ge 4 || exit 0; eslint *.js

  Only compile typescript if node version is at least 4.2:

  if-ver -ge 4.2 || exit 0; tsc

  Only run webpack if node version is (>= 4.3 && <5) || > 5.10:

  (if-ver -ge 4.3 && if-ver -lt 5) || if-ver -gt 5.10) || exit 0; webpack
